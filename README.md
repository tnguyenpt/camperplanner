# Project Starter

A clean repository scaffold for starting a new project.

## Structure
- `src/` application source code
- `tests/` automated tests
- `docs/` project docs
- `scripts/` helper scripts

## Getting Started
1. Choose a stack (Node, Python, etc.)
2. Add dependency/tooling config
3. Add first feature in `src/`
4. Add tests in `tests/`

## Git Workflow
- Create a feature branch
- Commit small, focused changes
- Open PRs with tests passing
